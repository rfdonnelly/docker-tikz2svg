= Comparison of TikZ to SVG Solutions
:toc: macro

This is an attempt to identify and compare the various solutions for converting TikZ to SVG.

This comparison optimizes for SVG output with special attention to the handling of fonts, filesize, and SVG client compatability.
Other outputs like PNG are a nice to have but have no bearing on the comparisons.

== Solutions

=== pdf2svg

Do not use.
Author recommends using `pdftocairo` instead.

[quote,Author of pdf2svg]
I recommend that you use [pdftocairo] since it is better maintained than [pdf2svg].

* Homepage: https://cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/
* Repo: https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg/

*Pros and Cons*

* (-) No longer maintained

=== pdftocairo

Promising.
Evaluate further.

* Homepage: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
* Repo: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler
* Documentation: https://man.archlinux.org/man/pdftocairo.1.en

*Pros and Cons*

* (+) Actively maintained
* (+) Part of the Poppler project
* (+) Several output options including SVG
* (+) Available in the Alpine Linux package repository.
See https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/contents?file=pdftocairo&path=&name=&branch=v3.17[pdftocairo] in the https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/v3.17/main/x86_64/poppler-utils[poppler-utils package].
* (-) Seems to have bugs with image scaling.
SVG image size is smaller than PDF image size.
This seems to be due to absence of units so px units get inferred when it should be explicit pt units.
PNG image size is larger than PDF image size.
* (-) Larger SVG file size than dvisvgm pdf->svg.
Could use a separate utility to optimize the SVG.

=== dvisvgm

Promising.
Evaluate further.

* Homepage: https://dvisvgm.de
* Repo: https://github.com/mgieseki/dvisvgm

*Pros and Cons*

* (+) Actively maintained
* (+) Can embed fonts which allows proper font rendering and selecting of text in browsers.
* (-) Not available in the Alpine Linux package repository.
See https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/contents?file=dvisvgm&path=&name=&branch=v3.17[dvisvgm].
Must compile from source.
* (-) Relies on deprecated GhostScript PostScript-based PDF interpreter which will be removed in GhostScript 10.01.0 in spring 2023.
Not compatible with new C-based PDF interpreter.
* (-) Does not render the focused ion beam example properly.
However, this might be an environment issue (e.g. incompatibility with GhostScript 10.0.0) since the dvisvgm FAQ https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/#clipping-issues[shows it rendering correctly].

=== tex4ht

* (-) Requires special commands in LaTeX source file?
